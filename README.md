## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Array Methods

### What I learned

I learned to make responsive website with the help of flex property. It make easier for us to make website responsive easily. And also I learned that without filter also we can add function for filtering job which was hard part of this challenge. I learned to search for problems and solve it and it improves my problem solving skill which is best. And I learned not to give up if we stuck we can overcome it event if it take many days weeks or months.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on improving writing javascript code clean effecient and more maintainable. I will continue learning problem solving skill and make more and more project. It was challenging for adding filter logic in which i was stuck the most i will keep improving in this areas and make websites more interactive.
Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. Also I will improve in my project planning which is the area i need to improve most.
